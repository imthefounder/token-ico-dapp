When users encounter errors, they will now see specific messages like:

❌ OLD: "Error! Try again later"
✅ NEW: "Insufficient funds to complete transaction. Please ensure you have enough ETH for the purchase amount plus gas fees."

❌ OLD: "Error! Try again later"  
✅ NEW: "Transaction was cancelled by user."

❌ OLD: "Error! Try again later"
✅ NEW: "Network connection issue. Please check your internet connection and try again."

This helps users understand exactly what went wrong and how to fix it!
